## **Servers**
 Servers are special computers connected directly to the Internet and webpages are files that are stored on these server's harddrives.

Every server has is own adress called "**IP adress**" that helps computers find each other. Names are used instead of IP adresses to make it easier to find.
The computers we have at home aren't computers because they're not connected directly to the Internet. They're called **clients** as they are connected to the Internet through an **Internet Service Provider**.
When we send an email to someone, the email, webpage or picture are broken into smaller pieces called packets and then reassembled in their original order.
When we send information through the internet, what keeps them from arriving on another computer is the IP adress, every device has one. At every intersection between a device and the Internet there is a router that directs the packets to the right IP adress.
